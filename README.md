Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic features.
The goal is to assist in early detection and decision-making support for healthcare professionals.

Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.

Objectives

Predict presence of heart disease from patient data

Compare multiple ML classification algorithms

Identify most influential medical features

Provide an easy-to-use prediction interface
